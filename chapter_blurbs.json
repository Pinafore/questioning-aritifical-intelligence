    "turing": "In the 1950s, Alan Turing proposed a parlor game that would come to define the goal of creating human-like artificial intelligence: could a wiley interrogator discern whom they were talking to just through posing clever questions.",
    "epic": "Despite its central importance to \abr{ai}, asking and answering questions is not a recent development---it stretches back into our collective unconcious.  Myths from several cultures connect the process of forming and answering critical questions to the process of forming identity, unlocking the secrets of the universe, and gaining intelligence.",
    "civilization": "Corruption and nepotism have been the downfall of multiple civilizations, but the administration of carefully formed questions saved the United States and China from sucumbing to these destructive forces.  This chapter reviews how the careful process of asking questions to check if people could do their jobs brough about massive social change and allowed egalitarian and professional governments to bring order to continent-spanning civilizations.",
    "ir": "Information retrieval is the foundation of many multi-billion dollar web companies from Baidu in China to Yandex in Russia to Google and Yahoo! in the US.  But none of these companies would exist without the ideas of reusable test collections and term-based queries, which came about because of a few crazy experiments that happened in a small UK University in Cranfield.  This chapter lays out the history of this methodology (which has become known as the Cranfield paradigm) and how it was used to answer questions."
