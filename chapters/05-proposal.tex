Questioning Artificial Intelligence: What the Differences between how Computers and Humans Answer Questions reveal about Intelligence and an AI-dominated Future.


Humans have been answering questions for millenia: \Oe{}dipus answering the Sphynx's riddles, civil servants proving their worth on exams, and contestants on \jeopardy{}.
%
But now computers are doing the same thing: answering idle questions on smart devices, competing on game shows, and threatening to take our jobs.
%
This book looks at how---despite the superficial similarity in the end result---dramatically different the underlying mechanisms for human and computer question answering are and what that says about the future of human--computer coexistance.
