In a previous video, I talked about how questions created modern civilization:
the use of exams to select civil servants.  Compared to the alternative that
preceded them, I think these tests were an unmitigated good.

Today, we’re talking about something where the verdict of history is less
clear-cut: standardized tests and the psychometric analysis that is applied on
top of them.  When standardized tests were introduced, the ideal was that
these tests could make admissions more scientific and less random or connected
to family ties.

At the end of the 19th century, a couple of universities banded together to
create the ``College Board'' to administer tests to see who could get into
universities like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.  Do well on the test, and you
get in!

We’ll talk about the math in the next video, but for now I want to focus on
the promise and the big picture of standarized testing and how it relates to
the leaderboards that have taken over machine learning.

Let’s talk about what the College Board and later Educational Testing Service
promises: anybody can sign up for a test whenever they want, and it gives a
number that pops out that accurately describes how smart they are.  Let’s call
that number theta to stand for the skill of a student.

So can you just report accuracy?  Would that be a good way of getting theta?
No!  The test in January might not be the same as the test in July.  So the
mathematical challenge is how to create that estimate theta so that it’s
consistent against different tests and to select questions from the pool of
possible questions so that you can reliably generate that number theta.  And
that’s where the ``standardized'' in standardized tests comes from.

The process has changed over the years\dots at first you had to give everybody
the same test at each offering of the test, but now they do adaptive testing
to do a better job of estimating theta for a specific test-taker.  But the two
big problems remain the same: making theta standardized and describing in
general what kind of questions they should be asking.

\jbgcomment{Need to also connect to leaderboards}

So why am I, a machine learning researcher, talking about this?  Is it because
I want to talk about how Harvard added admissions essays to standardized tests
because they were concerned that too many Jews were getting in?  Or because
the federal government deemed UCLA’s admissions policies racist because not
enough qualified Asians were getting in?  Or how there’s now a backlash
against standardized tests because African Americans systematically have lower
scores than other groups?  Nope!  As animated as I get about these topics,
these are decidedly out of scope of this video.

But I mention them because they’re definitely real problems, and causes a lot
of people to hate standardized tests.  But it’s not a problem with the *math*
behind standardized tests.  It’s a problem with the people who write the
questions and what happens when the results come out.  And QA systems aren’t
immune from these problems either, as I talk about elsewhere.  But the math is
sound.

Hopefully it reminds you of a leaderboard: systems come in, you need to give
them a score.  But the machine learning community has a distinct advantage
here.  You can wipe the memory of a computer system, so you can give it the
same test over and over again.  But as I argued before in my plea for an
embrace of the Manchester paradigm from trivia shows, this isn’t always the
case: there’s still some information that gets leaked.


So we’ll get into the math soon.  But it's not just for creating leader boards
in machine learning and natural language processing.  Very similar models are
used for rating players in chess and other games and for predicting how
politicians will vote on particular bills.

\section{Leaderboards are Shiny}
\label{ch:isicle:intro}


Leaderboards are widely used in \nlp{} and push the field forward.  While
leaderboards are a straightforward ranking of \nlp{} models, this simplicity
can mask nuances in evaluation \itms{} (examples) and \subjs{} (\nlp{}
models).  Rather than replace leaderboards, we advocate a re-imagining so that
they better highlight if and where progress is made.  Building on educational
testing, we create a Bayesian leaderboard model where latent \subj{} skill and
latent \itm{} difficulty predict correct responses.  Using this model, we
analyze the ranking reliability of leaderboards.  Afterwards, we show the
model can guide what to annotate, identify annotation errors, detect
overfitting, and identify informative examples.  We conclude with
recommendations for future benchmark tasks.


Leaderboard evaluations---for better or worse---are the
\textit{de facto} standard for measuring progress in question
answering~\citep{squad16} and in many \nlp{}
tasks~\citep{wang2019superglue}.
An unfortunate side effect of leaderboard popularity is \abr{sota}-chasing, often at the expense of carefully inspecting data and models~\citep{linzen2020progress}.
For example, the same  ``super-human'' models that top question answering leaderboards~\citep{najberg-18} often fail spectacularly~\citep{feng2018rawr,wallace2019universal} by learning non-generalizable statistical patterns~\citep{mccoy2019heuristics,niven2019probing}.
Finally, focusing \textit{solely} on metrics conflates progress on a specific \emph{task} with progress on real-world \nlp{} \emph{problems} behind the task~\citep{bender2020climbing}.
Plainly, focusing on headline \abr{sota} numbers ``provide(s) limited value for scientific progress absent insight into what drives them'' and where they fail~\citep{lipton2019troubling}.

In this work we take leaderboards ``as they are,'' and imagine how they
might better support research.
Leaderboards establish differences between
models on a fixed task.
Hence, leaderboards should enable and encourage the comparison of models and
inspection of examples.
And leaderboards should also signal when they have outlived their usefulness~\citep{boydgraber2020nerds}.

\begin{figure}[t]

  }
  \label{fig:irt-dist}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to Direct Leaderboards' Light}

To help focus attention on examples and models of interest, we propose
Difficulty and Ability Discriminating (\name{}) leaderboards that
explicitly model both task and submissions \emph{jointly}, rather than
either in isolation.
% \footnote{Source code, data, and visualizations at \projecturl{}.}
\name{}'s underlying model is based on Item Response Theory~\citep[\abr{irt},
reviewed in \S\ref{ch:isicle:lead}]{lord1968test,baker2001irt}, a widely
used~\citep{van2016assess} alternative in educational testing to simple
summary statistics~\citep{edgeworth1888exams}.

\name{} can explicitly identify the \emph{difficulty} and
  \emph{\discability{}} of \itms{} (Figure~\ref{fig:irt-dist}),\footnote{
  Example and feasibility distribution in
  Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:apx:examples}.  Interactive visualization linked
  from \href{https://irt.pedro.ai}{http://irt.pedro.ai}.  } which in turn can
  lead to a more nuanced ranking of models, identifying poor \itms{}, and
  better understanding of a dataset and task.  Throughout the paper, we use
  the question answering (\qa{}) benchmark
  \squad{}~2.0~\citep{rajpurkar2018know}.  For example, \name{} can identify
  questions that are challenging to models and questions that are wrong
  (incorrectly annotated).  In addition to better understanding datasets, it
  is also helpful for efficiently selecting evaluation items to annotate.  We
  conclude with recommendations for future leaderboards
  (\S\ref{ch:isicle:conc}) and discuss where \irt{} in \nlp{} can go next
  (\S\ref{ch:isicle:future}).

\subsection{How the SAT can Help Leaderboards}

If you’ve ever applied to a university, you’ve probably had to take a
standardized test.  As we talked above, the ``standardized'' in standardized
test means that the score you get makes sense no matter when you took the
test.  So how does the math work that lets that happen?

The big idea is that we want to model the probability of a person $j$ getting
question $i$ right.  We’re going to treat this as a logistic regression.  As
with every logistic regression, you pass some number through a sigmoid
function to generate a probability.  The number that you pass in this
function—like a feature in a logistic regression—helps explain your data. And
in the case the data are a big matrix of who got what questions right and who
got what questions wrong.

In the lingo of \abr{irt}, the questions are the ``items'', the agents answering
the questions are the ``subjects'' and then whether they got a question right or
not is the ``response''.  So now hopefully you see what it’s called item
response theory.  The goal is to predict each of these binary responses as if
it were a logistic regression.

So like all logistic regression, the prediction comes out of a sigmoid
function that you hopefully remember.  So what goes *in* to that sigmoid
function?  We’ll add more parameters soon, but let’s start with the first two:
difficulty and skill.

For concreteness, let's assume that we have a question-answering task and two \subj{}s: \smart{},
who is good at trivia, and \dumb{}, who is not.
In the simplest \irt{} models, each \subj{}~$j$ has a random
variable~$\theta_j$ corresponding to their skill: \smart{}'s is big,
\dumb{}'s is small.  The higher the skill number
(theta), the more likely they are to answer questions correctly.

But you cannot know that until you start asking them questions of
varying \iemph{difficulty}~$\beta_i$.
Harder questions have a higher difficulty (``what is the airspeed of
an unladen swallow'') than easy ones (``who is buried in Grant's
tomb'').
The bigger the margin between a \subj{}'s skill~$\theta_j$ and an \itm{}'s
difficulty~$\beta_i$, $\theta_j-\beta_i$, the more likely that \subj{}~$j$
responds correctly~$p_{i,j}(r_{i,j}=1)$.


So how do these two numbers feed into a sigmoid function?  You take the
difference between the difficult and the skill.  When the skill minus the
difficulty is high, the higher the probability of the subject answering it
correctly.  If the skill matches the difficulty, then the subject has a 50-50
chance of answering correctly.

Okay, so let’s make this a little more complicated and add two additional
terms: discriminability and feasibility: \discability{} $\gamma_i$ and
feasibility $\lambda_i$.

\paragraph{Discrimination}

Discriminability is how well the question distinguishes better subjects from
worse ones.  It’s multiplied by the difference between the skill and the
difficulty.  Mathematically, this changes the slope of the response curve.
%
A discriminative question is challenging but can still be answered
correctly by a strong \subj{}.
If \smart{}'s ability is higher than most \itms{}' difficulty
($\theta_j-\beta_i$ is large), \itm{} discriminability multiplies this
gap by $\gamma_i$.
Questions with low $\gamma_i$ are low quality: they have annotation
error or do not make sense.

Here’s a picture of that for a question with zero difficulty.  As the skill
(x-axis goes up), the more likely the subject is to answer the question.  The
bigger the discriminability, the steeper the curve.  Here it is for 0.5 and
here it is for 2.0.

This would never happen in practice, but let’s imagine you could create a test
set where every question had perfect discrimination.  Then the response curve
won’t be a curve, it’ll be a step function.  So let’s say you have a question
with difficulty 0.2 and perfect discrimination.  Anybody with skill greater
than 0.2 will get it right 100\% of the time.

But if you can do it once, you can do it again.  Let’s create several perfect
discriminators with a nice grid of difficulty.  So now, when a person comes
in, they’ll answer every question correct until their skill is surpassed by
the question.  First question they get wrong means they can leave the test and
go home early.

Again, this fantasy is impossible, but you can imagine why folks want these
sorts of questions on a standardized test.  There’s more information about a
subject’s skill for each question.

\paragraph{Feasibility}

Another way of capturing poor quality questions is the
feasibility~$\lambda_i$.
For example, if the question ``who was the first president'' has the
answer \answer{Rajendra Prasad}, the question has an unstated implicit
assumption that \subjs{} must guess what country or company the
question is about.
In the model {\bf \pl{3}}, if a large fraction of \subj{}s all get an
\itm{} wrong, everyone's probability of getting the \itm{} right is
capped at $\lambda_i$.
In \nlp{} terms, $1-\lambda_i$ corresponds to the prevalence of annotation
errors that lead to unsolvable \itm{}s.


Let’s now see what feasibility does.  Feasibility is relevant to NLP since
infeasible questions suggest an annotation error. Let’s go back to our
favorite ``bad'' question: what is the capital of Georgia?  If this sort of
question can have the answer ``Atlanta'' or ``Tblisi'' with equal probability,
then nobody, no matter how smart they are, can get this right with more than
0.5 probability.

Mathematically, see how the feasibility parameter works is more
straightforward.  It’s just a linear scaling, that brings down the maximum
value the probability can take on.  The normal logistic curve is on top,
lambda=1, but it gets squished down as lambda gets smaller and smaller.  If
lambda=½, then no matter how smart you are, it’s basically a coin flip whether
you can answer the question.

\section{A Generative Story for Leaderboards}
\label{ch:isicle:lead}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  % \includegraphics[width=.97\columnwidth, trim=0.5cm 0.3cm 2.6cm .4cm]{figures/leaderboard/leaderboard}
  \caption{
    A \name{} leaderboard uses \irt{} to jointly infer \itm{} \diff{} $\beta_i$, \discability{} $\gamma_i$, feasibility~$\lambda_i$, and \subj{} skill $\theta_j$.
    These predict the likelihood $p_{ij}(r_{ij}=1)$ of a correct response $r_{ij}$.
  }
  \label{fig:story}
\end{figure}

Leaderboards are a product of the metrics, evaluation data, and
\subj{}s (machine or human) who answer \itms{}
(Figure~\ref{fig:story}).


Generally, given $n$ test items $\mathcal{X}=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$
and $m$ \subj{}s
$\mathcal{S}=(S_1,\ldots,S_m)$, where each \subj{} answers every
item, we want to estimate \subj{} skills and \itm{} difficulties.
To discover the random variables that best explain the data, we
turn to probabilistic inference~\cite{pearl-88}.


Having introduced all of the constituent elements of the model, we can
now present the full generative model:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item For each subject $j$:
  \begin{enumerate*}
    \item Draw skill $\theta_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \tau_\theta^{-1})$
  \end{enumerate*}
  \item For each item $i$:
  \begin{enumerate*}
    \item Draw difficulty $\beta_i \sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_\beta, \tau_\beta^{-1})$
    \item Draw discriminability $\gamma_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\gamma, \tau_\gamma^{-1})$
    \item Draw feasibility $\lambda_i \sim \text{U}[0,1]$
  \end{enumerate*}
  \item Draw subject $i$ response on item $j$,\\$r_{ij} \sim p_{ij}(r_{ij} \mid \theta_j, \beta_i, \lambda_i )=$
    \begin{equation}
      p_{ij}(r_{ij}=1|\theta_j)=\frac{\lambda_i}{1+e^{-\gamma_i(\theta_j-\beta_i)}}.
      \label{eq:isicle:ours}
    \end{equation}
    For \pl{1}, $\gamma_i$ and $\lambda_i$ are fixed to 1.0, while for
    \pl{2}, only $\lambda_i$ is fixed.\footnote{In psychometrics, \pl{1}~is called a Rasch~\citep{rasch1960studies} or 1 parameter logistic (1PL) model, \pl{2}~is a 2PL model, and \pl{3}~is a 4PL model with guessing set to zero.}
\end{enumerate*}
Means $\mu_\theta,\mu_\beta,\mu_\gamma$ are drawn from
$\mathcal{N}(0,10^6)$ and $\tau_\theta,\tau_\beta,\tau_\gamma$
from a $\Gamma(1,1)$ prior, as in \citet{lalor2019latent} and
recommended by \citet{natesan2016birt}.\footnote{We differ by
  allowing $\gamma<0$ to identify bad \itms{}.  }

Because it is difficult to completely codify skill and difficulty into
a single number, we can rewrite the exponent in
Equation~\ref{eq:isicle:ours} as a sum over dimensions
$-\gamma_i(\sum_k \bm{\theta}_{j,k}-\bm{\beta}_{i,k})$,
where each dimension captures the interaction between an \itm{}'s
difficulty and a \subj{}'s skill.
For example, perhaps \dumb{} could better exploit artifacts in one
dimension (their skill for $\theta_{j,k=5}$ is high but everywhere
else is low) while \smart{} might not know much about a particular
topic like potent potables ($\theta_{j,k=2}$ is low but everywhere
else is high).
We call this model {\bf \pl{m}}.\footnote{
  We do not incorporate feasibility into the \pl{m}~model since it already improves over 1D models without it.
}
Multidimensional \irt{} models~\citep{reckase2009mirt} could---in addition to better modeling
difficulty---also cluster items for interpretation; we briefly
experiment with this (Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:clustering}), but leave
more to future work (\S\ref{ch:isicle:future}).

\subsection{Examples are Not Equally Useful}

\irt{}'s fundamental assumption is that not all \itms{} and
\subjs{} are equal.
This explains why leaderboards can fail while having
``normal looking'' accuracies.
As a thought experiment, consider a dataset that is one third easy
($\beta_i \in [0,1]$), one third medium difficulty
($\beta_i \in [2,3]$), and one third hard ($\beta_i \in [6,7]$).
Suppose that \smart{} has skill $\theta_{k}=4$ while \dumb{} has skill
$\theta_{b}= 2$.
A standard leaderboard would say that \smart{} has higher accuracy
than \dumb{}.
But suppose there's a new \subj{} that wants to challenge \smart{};
they are not going to reliably dethrone \smart{} until their skill
$\theta_{c}$ is greater than six.

This is a more mathematical formulation of the ``easy'' and ``hard''
dataset splits in question
answering~\citep{sugawara2018easier,Rondeau2018-um,sen2020learn}.
In \pl{3}, this recapitulates the observation of
\citet{boydgraber2020nerds} that annotation error can hinder effective
leaderboards.
\name{} helps systematize these observations and diagnose dataset issues.


\subsection{Inference}

To estimate the latent parameters of our model, we use mean-field
variational inference~\cite{jordan-99}.
In variational inference, we propose a distribution over the latent
variables,~$q_\phi(\cdot)$, that approximates the true but intractable
posterior~$p(\cdot)$.
We then minimize the \abr{kl}-divergence between these distributions,
equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower-bound (\textsc{elbo}) with
respect to the variational parameters.

In our case, $q_\phi(\cdot)$ is a mean-field distribution, which means it
factorizes over each of the latent variables (the product is over the
$n \times m$ subject-item pairs)
\begin{align*}
  q_\phi(\bm{\theta}, \bm{\beta}, \bm{\gamma}, \bm{\mu}, \bm{\tau}) = q(\bm{\mu})q(\bm{\tau})\prod_{i,j} q(\theta_j)q(\beta_i)q(\gamma_i)
\end{align*}
Specifically, for our key latent variables $z \in \{\bm{\theta}, \bm{\beta}, \bm{\gamma}\}$, the associated variational distributions are of the form $q(z) = \mathcal{N}(u_z, t_z^{-1})$.
Recall that in the generative distribution, each latent $z$ is drawn from a $\mathcal{N}(\mu_z, \tau_z^{-1})$ whose parameters are also latent variables; for these variables, we use the variational distributions $q(\mu_z) = \mathcal{N}(u_{\mu_z}, t_{\mu_z}^{-1})$ and $q(\tau_z) = \Gamma(a_{\tau_z}, b_{\tau_z})$. We optimize the \textsc{elbo} with respect to the variational parameters
\begin{align*}
  \bm{\phi} & =\{\bm{u}_z,\bm{t}_z,\bm{u}_{\mu_z},\bm{t}_{\mu_z},\bm{a}_{\tau_z},\bm{b}_{\tau_z},\bm{\lambda}\}
\end{align*}
for all $z$ using \abr{adam}~\citep{Kingma2014AdamAM}.

With \name{}'s leaderboard \irt{} model introduced, we next discuss
how leaderboard \subj{}s are statistically compared and alternative
methods---such as using \irt{} parameters---to evaluate whether two
models are truly different.
\section{Ranking and Comparing Subjects}
\label{ch:isicle:compare}


Fundamentally, the objective of comparative evaluations like
leaderboards is to decide whether model~$A$ is better than model~$B$.
A thread of \nlp{} has rightfully advocated for adding rigor to these
decisions using statistics~\citep[Classical Testing
  Theory]{traub1997ctt} where the objective is to infer a true
score~$T$ from the observed test score~$X=T+E$ given a measurement
error~$E$, uniform across \subj{}s.
However, in educational testing---a field measuring skill and
knowledge in humans---\irt{} is a primary measurement
instrument~\citep[p.~2]{hambleton1991fundamentals}.
A major motivation for \irt{} is that \subj{}s of different skill have
\iemph{different} errors.
\irt{} explicitly accounts for the bandwidth-fidelity
dilemma~\citep{mcbride1976bandwidth}: \itms{} can either accurately
measure a narrow ability range (fidelity) \textit{or} inaccurately
measure large ability ranges (bandwidth).\footnote{Estimation error
  of $\theta$ varies by position (Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:irt-test}).  }
This section and the next contrast methods for identifying the best
model and advocate for \irt{}.

\label{ch:isicle:agg}


Implicit in nearly all leaderboard evaluations is ranking models by a
statistic such as the average accuracy.
As we show in \S\ref{ch:isicle:exp}, na\"ive rankings are noisier than \irt{} rankings.
\section{IRT for Leaderboards}
\label{ch:isicle:exp}

Leaderboards should: (1) reliably and efficiently rank
better models ahead of worse
models~\citep{sutcliffe1992pragmatics,voorhees2003evaluating} and (2)
guide inspection of \itms{} and \subjs{} (\S\ref{ch:isicle:interp}).
The first ameliorates the unavoidable randomness
of finite evaluations while the second enables
error analysis~\citep{wu2019errudite} and model
probing~\citep{belinkov2019survey,zhang2019manifold}.
First we verify that \irt{} models accurately predict the \resps{} of
\subjs{} (\S\ref{ch:isicle:irt-accurate}).
Next, a ranking stability analysis shows that \irt{} has
modestly better reliability than classical rankings
(\S\ref{ch:isicle:irt-compare}).
Lastly, using \irt{} to actively sample \itms{} for annotation yields
rankings with better correlation to complete test data
(\S\ref{ch:isicle:sampling}).

\subsection{Why a Linear Model Baseline}

At first blush, the differences between \irt{} and logistic regression
are minimal, but we include the comparison to address natural
questions from the \abr{nlp} community:
(1) do the idiosyncrasies of the \irt{} formulation hurt
accuracy?
(2) should we add features to better understand phenomena
in the questions?
(3) why not use deep models?

The next section argues that both \irt{} and logistic regression are
accurate even without laboriously engineered task-specific features.
Adding obvious features such as \itm{} words (e.g., questions)
only minimally improves the accuracy.
We explicitly omit less interpretable deep models since our goal is to
make leaderboards \emph{more} interpretable.

\subsection{Response Prediction is Accurate}
\label{ch:isicle:irt-accurate}

Just as educational testing researchers validate \irt{} models by
seeing if they predict \subj{} \resps{}
correctly~\citep{aera2014standards}, we validate how well \name{} predicts
whether \squad{} models get questions right.

We compare against a logistic regression linear model (\abr{lm})
implemented with Vowpal Wabbit~\citep{Agarwal2014ARE}.
Since integrating hand-crafted features is easy, we incorporate
features derived from \subj{} \abr{id}s; \itm{} \abr{id}s; functions
of the \squad{} question, answer, and title; and \irt{} parameters
(details in Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:apx:features}).
As in \irt{}, logistic regression predicts whether a \subj{} correctly
responds to an \itm{}.
Later, we discuss ways to integrate more features into \irt{}
(\S\ref{ch:isicle:future}).

\subsection{SQuAD Leaderboard Data}
\label{ch:isicle:datasets}
Experiments are on the \squad{} 2.0 leaderboard.
Development data are publicly available, and organizers provide test set responses.
There are $161$ development \subjs{}, $115$ test \subjs{}, and \num[group-separator={,}]{11873} \itms{} ($1.9$ million total pairs).
Experiments that do not need test responses use all development \subjs{}; those that do use the smaller test subset.

\subsection{Evaluation Scheme}

Following prior work~\citep{wu2020virt}, we evaluate \irt{} and linear models by holding out 10\% of responses and computing classification metrics.\footnote{Everywhere else in the paper, we train on all responses.}
In \squad{}, predicting whether a \resp{} is correct is an imbalanced
classification problem (80.4\% of responses in the development set are
correct).
Thus, we use \abr{roc auc}, macro F1, and accuracy.

\subsection{IRT Response Prediction is Accurate}
\label{ch:isicle:irt-compare}

\irt{} models that incorporate more priors into the generative story should be better, but are they?
We compare four \irt{} models: \pl{1}, \pl{2}, \pl{3}, and \pl{m}~(\S\ref{ch:isicle:lead}).
The more sophisticated models are better and all improve over the
\abr{lm} (Figure~\ref{fig:vw-ablation}) and correlate well with each other (Appendix~\ref{apx:irt-self-corr}).
To be clear, while higher accuracy than \abr{lm} is good, our goal is to validate that \irt{} models are accurate; later, we inspect model errors and identify annotation errors (\S\ref{ch:isicle:interp}).

\begin{figure*}[th]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/leaderboard/vw_ablation}
    \caption{
        We compare each \irt{} and linear model (\abr{lm}) by how well they predict \subj{} \resps{}.
        We focus on \abr{roc auc} since predicting responses is an imbalanced classification problem (most \subjs{} are correct).
        Under that metric, all \irt{} models improve over the best
        \abr{lm}, and the strongest \abr{lm} ablation only uses \irt{} features.
        That textual features are predictive in the \abr{lm} suggests they could improve future models.
    }
    \label{fig:vw-ablation}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{What Model Features are Predictive?}

Integrating additional features into Bayesian models is not trivial,
so we instead use the flexibility of linear models to identify useful
features.
Our leave-one-in ablation compares features (Figure~\ref{fig:vw-ablation}):
the top ablations both use \irt{} features, further validating
\irt{} parameters.
The \subj{} and \itm{} identifier features are also
strongly predictive, but \itm{} is the stronger of the two.
Text-based features are weaker, but this suggests future work to
better integrate them into \irt{} models (\S\ref{ch:isicle:future}).



\subsection{Ranking with IRT}

Leaderboards should produce \iemph{reliable} \subj{} rankings: can
\name{} rank systems even with a tiny test set?
Thus, we compare the correlation both of traditional average accuracy
(\S\ref{ch:isicle:agg}) and \irt{} rankings on the whole test
set compared to the rankings of the same metric on a smaller test set.
Our first experiment (\S\ref{ch:isicle:stable}) examines the stability
of existing \itms{} and \subjs{} while the second
(\S\ref{ch:isicle:sampling}) investigates stability of ``new''
evaluation data using sampling strategies.

\subsection{IRT Rankings Have Better Reliability}
\label{ch:isicle:stable}

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/leaderboard/stability_simulation_corr}
    \caption{
        Compared to the final ranking over a large test set, how well does a small test set correlate?
                The left shows correlation between mutually exclusive development set samples and the right between development samples and the full test set.
                In both experiments (panes), ranking systems by \irt{} ability is more stable---across all sample sizes---than mean accuracy and thus more reliable (Kendall's rank correlation is higher).
                Bands show 95\% confidence intervals of rank correlations across ten trials per sample size.
    }
    \label{fig:stability}
\end{figure*}

Rankings should be reliable within the same dataset (e.g., on dev
set) and generalize to similar datasets (e.g., with a test dataset).
To test the first, we measure the ranking stability of mutually
exclusive samples of the development
data~\cite{buckley2000measure}.
To test the second, we measure the correlation between
development set sample rankings to test set rankings~\citep{voorhees1998var}.

Specifically, for a range of sample sizes\footnote{ The sample size
    must be less than half the size of the development data so that we
    can obtain two samples.  } we (1) sample two partitions of the data,
(2) compute the classical ranking\footnote{For \squad{}, ordering by
    mean exact match score.} and the \irt{} ranking from a refit
\pl{3}~model, then (3) compute Kendall's
correlation~\citep{kendall1938tau} between the samples for each
ranking (details in Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:apx:rank-stability}).
In both cases \irt{} rankings have higher correlation than classical
rankings (Figure~\ref{fig:stability}, left).
Since the benefit is strongest at low sample sizes, \irt{} can improve
the reliability of small-scale evaluations.

The second experiment examines ranking generalization: \irt{} yields more reliable measures of \subj{} skill,  implying a greater consistency in subject rankings across evaluation settings.
Figure~\ref{fig:stability} compares the development set sample rankings computed above to rankings obtained using subjects' \emph{test} set responses (with the same \irt{} model).

Across all sample sizes, subjects' \irt{} ability estimated on the
development set correlates well test set ability.
Crucially, this is better than the corresponding classical metrics
like accuracy (Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:apx:rank-stability} quantifies
the statistical significance of the difference), supporting our
original motivation for using \irt{}.\footnote{ Since the maximum trial size was
    limited, we train one final model with the full data, see
    Table~\ref{tab:rank-corr} in the
    Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:apx:rank-stability}.  }

\subsection{IRT Improves Cold Start Reliability}
\label{ch:isicle:sampling}

\irt{} can also guide the construction of tests.
Just as \irt{} practitioners prepare tests for humans, we too construct tests for machines.
In educational testing, collecting responses from humans is expensive; likewise, although \emph{questions} are cheap in search-based \qa{} tasks~\citep{Nguyen2016MSMA,kwiatkowski2019nq}, annotating \emph{answers} is expensive.
Likewise, ``grading'' machine dialog responses is expensive and \irt{} helps~\citep{sedoc2020irt}.
To emulate this setting, we use computerized adaptive testing~\citep{weiss1984cat} to iteratively select \squad{} \itms{} to ``annotate.''

As in human test preparation, we use existing annotations to infer
\itm{} parameters and iteratively infer the ability of new \subjs{}.
This experiment splits~$m$ \subjs{} into a training group (80\%) and a
testing group (20\%).
The training group represents \subjs{} for which we have full \itm{}
predictions and annotations; the testing group represents a new group
of \subjs{} that we need to rank.
To efficiently rank, we should iteratively choose \itms{} to annotate that yield the most information about the ranking if all the data were annotated.

This experiment compares how well several \itm{} selection strategies work.
For each selection method, we (1) choose a sample size, (2), sample
from the development set, (3) compute the ranking of \subjs{}, and (4)
compute Kendall's rank correlation
(Figure~\ref{fig:stability:sampling}).\footnote{We compute correlations with the complete development set on ten trials to build $95\%$ confidence intervals.}


\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/leaderboard/cat_sampling_rank}
    \caption{
        Suppose we need to cold start and collect annotations for a new \subj{}: what order would most rapidly increase correlation to the full test data?
        As we expect, the correlations eventually converge, but with little data, \irt{} has better correlation than other methods.
        We suspect that the \irt{} information underperforms early on
        when the \subj{} ability estimate is unstable.
    }
    \label{fig:stability:sampling}
\end{figure}


Which \itm{} selection strategies should we compare?
As a baseline, we use na\"ive random sampling.
Like prior work, we compare selecting \itms{} with the highest \diff{} and the highest \discability{}~\citep{lalor2019latent} as well as the sum of the two.\footnote{We train an \pl{2}~model to simplify sampling (e.g., avoiding a tradeoff between feasibility and \discability{}).}
We propose that \itms{} should be selected according to their Fisher information content~\citep{weiss1982info}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:info}
    I_i(\theta_j)=\frac{(p_{ij}')^2}{p_{ij}(1-p_{ij})}=\gamma_i^2 p_{ij}(1-p_{ij})
\end{equation} as derived by \citet[p. 70]{lord1968test}.

Intuitively, if we do not yet know the true skill~$\theta_j$, we should pick \itms{} whose expected response we are most uncertain about.
Our uncertainty (entropy) is maximized when the likelihood of a correct response $p_{ij}$ is the same as the likelihood of an incorrect response $1-p_{ij}$, which corresponds to the maximal value of $I_i(\theta_j)$; it is also sensible this value increases as \discability{} $\gamma_i$ increases.

To infer the maximally informative \itms{}, we estimate the ability
$\theta_j$ of each \subj{} using the currently selected \itms{}, use
the ability to compute the information
of each yet-to-be-annotated \itm{} for each \subj{}, and then aggregate the informativeness
\begin{equation}
    \text{Info}(i)=\sum_j I_i(\theta_j)
\end{equation}
by \itm{}~$i$ summed over \subjs{}~$j$.
This approach is similar to uncertainty sampling and reduces to it for the \pl{1}~model~\citep{lewis1994uncertainty}.
We initially seed with the twenty-five most discriminative \itms{} (details in Appendix~\ref{ch:isicle:apx:rank-stability}).

Like computerized adaptive testing~\citep{moreno1984cat}, Figure~\ref{fig:stability:sampling} shows that at lower sample sizes three of the \irt{} sampling methods are better than random sampling---\diff{} does worse.
The other \irt{} methods have comparable correlation.
Thus, by using \irt{}, \name{} can both improve rankings and guide annotation.
\section{Qualitative Insights on Leaderboards}
\label{ch:isicle:interp}

\name{} also helps qualitative analysis of \itms{} and \subjs{}.
First, \irt{} identifies overfitting and generalizes partitioning datasets by \diff{}.
Then we show that---like in educational testing---\irt{} identifies good and bad \itms{}.

\subsection{Guiding Analysis with IRT}

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/leaderboard/irt_confusion}
    \caption{
        We partition evaluation data by \irt{} \diff{} and
        \discability{} with accuracy in each quartile.
        Most improvements in high-accuracy systems come from getting
        high-difficulty questions right.
        \Itms{} with low \discability{} (and thus prone to annotation errors) are difficult for all \subjs{} except the overfit \abr{args-bert} model.
        We include top-performing \squad{} \subjs{}, several notable
        \subjs{} (systems), and a pair from the bottom of the leaderboard.
    }
    \label{fig:confusion}
\end{figure*}

Several works curate easy and hard \abr{qa} subsets based on how many
models answer correctly~\citep{Rondeau2018-um} or
heuristics~\citep{sugawara2018easier}.
\irt{} can create similar subsets using \pl{3}, the best 1D model.
\Diff{} finds where \subjs{} improve while \discability{} and
feasibility can surface \itms{} that may be invalid.
For example, one low feasibility question (Figure~\ref{fig:ex-feas}) asks
``what are two examples of types of Turing machines?'' which has two
problems: (1) the answer omits five types and (2) span-based
evaluation precludes selecting non-contiguous types.

After excluding \itms{} with negative \discability{}---they are
likely erroneous---we sort \itms{} into bins.
We break both \diff{} and \discability{} into four bins---taking the 25\textsuperscript{th},
50\textsuperscript{th}, and 75\textsuperscript{th}
percentiles---creating eight total bins.
Then we select representative \squad{} \subjs{} with their
exact match scores (Figure~\ref{fig:confusion}).
Let's examine a feasible \itm{} with positive \diff{} and \discability{} like ``what reform was attempted following the Nice treaty?''\footnote{
    A: ``there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the \abr{eu} and make it more transparent.'' (Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:ex-reasonable})
}
In this case, the annotator's span is too long---resulting in almost
no correct answers and a low fuzzy match (token F1).
In contrast, one highly discriminative question succeeds because there
are multiple plausible guesses to ``who did the Normans team up with
in Anatolia?''\footnote{ Example with statistics in Appendix
    Figure~\ref{fig:ex-tricky}.
}
While both \answer{the Armenian state} and \answer{Turkish forces} are
superficially plausible answers, only \answer{Turkish forces} is correct;
nonetheless, some models are fooled.
Using \irt{} to guide \subj{} analysis is helpful; next, we test how
efficient it is in identifying annotation error.

\subsection{Identifying Annotation Error}

To test if \irt{} can identify annotation error, we inspect sixty \squad{} development set \itms{}.
We select ten \itms{} from each of these groups: the most negative \discability{}, \discability{} nearest to zero, the highest \discability{}, the least difficult, most difficult, and \irt{} model errors.
For each, we annotate whether the \itm{} was correct, was ``correct'' yet flawed in some way, or simply wrong (Figure~\ref{fig:example-error}).\footnote{
    Annotation guidelines provided in supplementary materials; Figure~\ref{fig:example-error} uses the first set of annotations which were later augmented by two additional sets of annotations.
}
Inter-annotator agreement between three authors on this three-way annotation with Krippendorff's $\alpha$~\citep{kripp2004,artstein2008inter} is $0.344$.
Despite only modest agreement, just as in the development of education tests, negative \discability{} is predictive of bad \itms{}.
When \discability{} is negative, then the probability of getting
the answer right is higher when ability is \emph{lower}, which is
undesirable: \smart{} consistently loses to \dumb{} on those \itms{}.
This could identify bad \itms{} in evaluation sets for removal.
\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/leaderboard/example_analysis.pdf}
    \caption{
        We annotate \squad{} \itms{} by \discability{}, \diff{}, and \irt{} prediction errors.
        For example, one question with negative \discability{} was classified as ``Wrong'' with the explanation that the annotated answer indicates it is \iemph{not} answerable, but the question actually \iemph{is} answerable.
        \Itms{} with negative \discability{} or where \irt{}'s prediction is wrong have a much higher rate of annotation error (``Flawed'' or ``Wrong'').
        Using similar methodology, errors in datasets could be more rapidly identified.
    }
    \label{fig:example-error}
\end{figure*}
\section{A Re-Imagined Leaderboard Dashboard}
\label{ch:isicle:vis}
\prtodoi{Move to separate demo paper}

Basing a new leaderboard on \irt{} models has another significant benefit: as they are purposefully interpretable, they are very useful for visualizing leaderboard data.
The final component of this work is a demonstration---based on \squad{}---of components that a re-imagined leaderboard may have.\footnote{
    The visualization doubles as my course project for CMSC734: Information Visualization.
}
Our proposed visualization has three main components: (1) an improved model listing, (2) a model-centric view, (3) an example-centric view.

The majority of leaderboards list only one ranking metric or list multiple while only ordering models by a primary metric.
However, multiple factors---including multiple metrics---should be integrated such as model size and efficiency~\citep{strubell2019energy}.
This presents a challenge: how should all these be visualized?
In our proposed model listing, while there would be a default ranking, our visualization would support ranking by any metric or combinations of rankings while showing the influence of each as in the parallel axis plots in LineUp~\citep{gratzl2013lineup}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=.25\columnwidth]{figures/leaderboard/end_error_compare}
    \caption{
        A proof-of-concept visualization that compares two models---a \bert{} and \ir{} retrieval system---by visualizing which examples model agree or disagree on.
        We propose extending this to incorporate more than two models.
    }
    \label{fig:pair}
\end{figure}

Similarly to Manifold~\citep{zhang2019manifold}, the goal of the model-centric view is to understand the differences---based on predictions---between models.
An initial approach (Figure~\ref{fig:pair}) compares how pairs of models differ, but could be extended to support multiple models by enhancing the underlying software.
Another approach to a model-centric views instead attempts at characterizing the performance along partitions of the data~\citep{liu2018answer}.
For example, \citet{arendt2020crosscheck} propose faceted histograms as a way to ``un-aggregate'' metrics to inspect \qa{} accuracy by factors like question type and confidence.
In addition to visualizing which instances pairs of models agree as in Manifold, we propose integrating \irt{} parameters to better identify instances that have a larger influence over the output ranking.

A dominant approach to inspecting models examines their performance on individual examples or partitions of examples sharing a trait~\citep{wadhwa2018compare}.
In addition to domain-relevant traits, we can guide example sample selection with \irt{} which makes it more likely to identify important issues over random sampling~\citep{wadhwa2018compare} while still combining careful specification of error types~\citep{wu2019errudite}.
Similarly, visualizations can use the multidimensional \irt{} parameters for clustering which can also be combined with domain-specific attributes like question type or topic.

A major advantage of our approach---embedding these comparisons in leaderboards---is that model developers can compare the outputs of many models on individual or small sets of examples.
While there are numerous tools for comparing models, error analysis, and related tasks, they face the headwinds of convincing practitioners that they are worthwhile time investments.
Instead, we aim to provide real benefits of leaderboard-wide analysis without incurring up-front time commitment from practitioners.
Although this does require commitment from task organizers, we believe that the trade-off of inherently improving the evaluation while providing practitioners with ``shiny tools'' is well worth it.
\section{Related Work}
\label{ch:isicle:rel}

\name{} draws together two primary threads: we use \irt{} to
understand datasets, which has been applied to other \abr{nlp} tasks,
and apply it to improving leaderboards.
Finally, we explore how the insights of \irt{} can improve not just
the analysis of test sets but to improve the \emph{construction} of
test sets.

\paragraph{\textbf{\abr{irt} in \abr{nlp}}}
\irt{} is gaining traction in machine learning
research~\citep{martinez2016ml,martinez2019irt} where automated metrics can be
misleading~\citep{sedoc2019chateval}: machine
translation~\citep{hopkins2013competitions} and chatbot
evaluation~\citep{sedoc2020irt}.
Concurrent with our work, \citet{vania2021compare} compare \nlp{} test sets with \irt{}.
Closest to our work in \nlp{} is \citet{otani2016aggregation}, who
rank machine translation \subjs{} and compute correlations with gold
scores.  Similarly, \citet{martinez2020indicators} use \irt{} on
non-language \abr{ai} video game benchmarks.
Just as we use \irt{} to identify difficult or easy \itms{},
\citet{lalor2016irt} create challenge sets for textual entailment.
We
test \irt{} as a way to guide annotation, but it can also
train \nlp{} models; for example, deep models learn ``easy'' examples
faster~\citep{lalor2018diff} and maintain test accuracy when training
data are down-sampled~\citep{lalor2019latent}.

\paragraph{\textbf{Improving Leaderboards}}
The rise \nlp{} leaderboards has encouraged critical thought into
improving them~\citep{linzen2020progress}, improving evaluation more
broadly~\citep{eger2020workshop}, and thoughtful consideration of
their influence on the direction of
research~\citep{sculley2018curse,dotan2020value}.
\name{} aims make leaderboard
yardsticks~\citep{hernandez2020yardsticks} more reliable,
interpretable, and part of curating the benchmark itself.
In line
with our reliability goal, just as statistical tests should appear in
publications~\citep{dror2018guide,Dodge2019ShowYW}, they should be
``freebies'' for leaderboard
participants~\citep{ethayarajh2020utility}.  Alternatively,
\citet{hou2019leader} posit that leaderboards could be automatically
extracted from publications.
How to aggregate multi-task
benchmarks~\citep{wang2018glue,wang2019superglue,fisch2019mrqa} and multi-metric benchmarks~\citep{ma2021dynaboard} is an
open question which---although we do not address---is one use for
\irt{}.


This work implicitly argues that leaderboards should be
continually updated.  As a (static) leaderboard ages, the task(s)
overfit~\citep{recht2019generalize} which---although
mitigable~\citep{blum2015ladder,andersonCook2019host}---is best solved
by continually collecting new data~\citep{kiela2021dynabench}.
Ideally, new data should challenge models through adversarial
collection~\citep{wallace2018trick,nie2019adversarial} and related
methods~\citep{Gardner2020-gn}.  However, if making an easy
leaderboard more difficult is possible, the
leaderboard has outlived its helpfulness and should be retired~\citep{voorhees1999trec8}.

Part of our work centers on alternate task efficacy rankings, but this
na\"ively assumes that task efficacy is the sole use case of
leaderboards.
Indeed, focusing solely these factors can mislead the
public~\citep{paullada2020data} and may not reflect human language
capabilities~\citep{schlangen2020targeting}.
Leaderboards are also well positioned to provide incentive structures
for participants to prioritize fairness~\citep{bender2018data} and
efficiency~\citep{strubell2019energy,schwartz2020green,min2021efficientqa}
or incorporate testing of specific
capabilities~\citep{ribeiro2020checklist,Dunietz2020-ty}.
To enable these more nuanced analyses, leaderboards should accept
runnable models rather than static
predictions~\citep{ma2021dynaboard}.

\paragraph{\textbf{Active Learning}}
Beyond \irt{}, the analysis of training dynamics and active learning~\citep{settles09active} is helpful for actively sampling specific \itms{} or identifying low-quality \itms{}~\citep{brodley1999mislabel}.
For example, \citet{swayamdipta2020cartography} and \citet{pleiss2020aum} propose alternative training dynamics-based methods for identifying difficult \itms{} as well annotation errors.
Even closer to goals, \citet{rahman2020active} use active learning to build a test collection.
Explicitly measuring how effectively examples separate the best \subj{} from the rest allows test set curators to ``focus on the bubble''~\citep{boydgraber2020nerds}, prioritizing examples most likely to reveal interesting distinctions between submitted systems.

\paragraph{\textbf{Alternate Formulations}}
\irt{} is an example of convergent evolution of models that
predict \subj{} action given an \itm{}.
Ideal point models~\cite{poole2017voting} consider how a legislator (\subj{})
will vote on a bill (\itm{}) and use a similar mathematical formulation.
The venerable \abr{elo} model~\cite{glickman-99} and modern
extensions~\cite{herbrich-07} predict whether a player (\subj{}) will
defeat an opponent (\itm{}) with, again, a similar mathematical model.
Certain \irt{} models can also be formulated as nonlinear mixed
models~\cite{rijmen2003nonlinear}, where the \itm{} parameters are fixed effects
and the latent \subj{} parameters are random effects.
This allows for comparisons between \irt{} models and other mixed effects models
under a consistent framework.
        {\bf \pl{1}} and {\bf \pl{2}} can be formulated as nonlinear mixed models, and {\bf \pl{3}} can be formulated as a discrete mixture model over~\itm{}s.
As we discuss further in the next section, \name{}'s application of
\irt{} can further be improved by adopting interpretable extensions of
these models.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:isicle:conc}

This paper advocates incorporating decades of research in crafting education tests to improve how we evaluate the capabilities of \abr{nlp} models.
We propose and validate an alternate \irt{} ranking method for leaderboard evaluations, show it can guide annotation, detect annotation error, and naturally partition evaluation data.
Just as educators moved from classical testing to \irt{}, the \nlp{} community should consider future evaluations with \irt{}.


\subsection{Limitations}
Although there is much to gain through \irt{} evaluation, there are limitations which make it hard to implement.
First, it requires access to item-level responses for all examples for all \subjs{} which are often only available to organizers.
Second, \citet{urbano2016reliability} notes that sampling mutually exclusive subsets has drawbacks---samples are not entirely independent.
Lastly, our work is a proof of concept using \squad{} 2.0 as a test bed and our results may not generalize.

\section{Future Work}
\label{ch:isicle:future}

We see a few directions for future work.
First, this paper is intended to validate \irt{} and its usefulness as an active part of the leaderboard lifecycle; the natural next step is to implement it in a leaderboard.
Second, our \irt{} models do not incorporate the \itm{} content (e.g., example text) to predict responses, but in principle could; Bayesian models with metadata~\citep{card2018meta} and ideal point models from political science~\citep{poole1985spatial} that incorporate bills and speeches do exactly this~\citep{gerrish2011text,nguyen2015tea,kraft2016vote}.
Analogously, \irt{} for leaderboards can and should also incorporate text from passages, questions, and answers to better model what makes questions difficult.
Such a model can also predict which characteristics would create discriminating or difficult \itms{}.
Lastly, multidimensional \irt{} models to evaluate multiple skills could aid multi-task or multi-metric leaderboards like \abr{mrqa}~\citep{fisch2019mrqa} and Dynaboard~\citep{ma2021dynaboard}.

      A number of researchers (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the \answer{demand for higher quality housing increased} (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.

\section{Logistic Regression Features}
\label{ch:isicle:apx:features}

The linear model (\S\ref{ch:isicle:irt-accurate}) includes features based on \itm{} \abr{id}s, \subj{} \abr{id}s, textual features of the question, context, and answer, and topic model features.
Table~\ref{tab:vw-features} lists the feature names from Figure~\ref{fig:vw-ablation} with descriptions of each.
When \irt{} features or the statistics features are used, they include interaction terms with themselves.

\section{IRT Model Type Correlation}
\label{apx:irt-self-corr}

Although each \irt{} model differs in expressiveness, they should---in general---produce similar results.
This is confirmed by computing the Kendall's rank correlation between the \subj{} abilities and \itm{} difficulties (Table~\ref{tab:irt-subj-corr}).

\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \small
      \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Ability & \pl{3}  & \pl{2}  & \pl{1}  \\
    \midrule
    \pl{3}  & $1.00$  & $0.947$ & $0.895$ \\
    \pl{2}  & $0.947$ & $1.00$  & $0.907$ \\
    \pl{1}  & $0.895$ & $0.907$ & $1.00$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{
    Table entries are Kendall's $\tau$ rank correlation of \irt{} \subj{} ability between rows and columns.
    Generally, the models agree on the ranking with the \pl{3}~and \pl{2}~having the strongest correlation.
  }
  \label{tab:irt-subj-corr}
\end{table}
\section{Ranking Stability Experiments}
\label{ch:isicle:apx:rank-stability}

Here we provide further details for the ranking stability experiments (\S\ref{ch:isicle:irt-compare}).
First, we filter from the $161$ \subjs{} that have development set scores to the $115$ that also have test set scores.\footnote{
  The \squad{} organizers curate the test set \subjs{} to avoid overfit, garbage, or duplicate submissions.
}
In our simulation, we run $10$ trials for every sample size; sample size begins at $100$ and with steps of $100$.
In addition to these, we also run trials for sample sizes 25, 50, and 75.
Since each sample can be no larger than half the dataset, we stop at half the dataset.

\subsection{Development and Test Set Correlations}
\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \small
      \begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
    \toprule
    {}                      & EM$_{\text{dev}}$ & EM$_{\text{test}}$ & Ability$_{\text{dev}}$ & Ability$_{\text{test}}$ \\
    \midrule
    EM$_{\text{dev}}$       & $1.00$            & $0.953$            & $0.954$                & $0.931$                 \\
    EM$_{\text{test}}$      & $0.953$           & $1.00$             & $0.944$                & $0.947$                 \\
    Ability$_{\text{dev}}$  & $0.954$           & $0.944$            & $1.00$                 & $0.950$                 \\
    Ability$_{\text{test}}$ & $0.931$           & $0.947$            & $0.950$                & $1.00$                  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{
    Entries are Kendall's rank correlation between rows and columns.
    Scores are \squad{} Exact Match (EM) and \pl{2}~ability.
  }
  \label{tab:rank-corr}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:rank-corr} uses a \pl{2}~model since we noticed that in comparison~\pl{3}~overfit the data, yielding worse results.
The correlations with the full data are all strong, but not the same.
We conclude that---at least on \squad{}---\irt{} rankings are modestly more reliable than classical rankings.

\subsection{Statistical Significance of Difference in Kendall Tau Coefficients}
While Figure~\ref{fig:stability} shows a consistent difference in correlation between ranking methods, it is unclear whether this difference is statistically significant.
We estimate the statistical significance of the difference through bootstrap sampling~\citep{efron1994bootstrap}.

Since the null case is no difference in correlation coefficients, we seek a symmetric sampling distribution centered at zero that represents a realistic density function.
Each ranking stability experiment\footnote{One experiment for development sample to development sample and one for development sample to test set.} trial results in two lists of number pairs.
The lists correspond to \subj{} scores on two datasets;\footnote{
  In the first experiment, development set samples; in the second, a development set sample and the full test set.
} each number pair is the \subj{}'s accuracy and \irt{} score.
To create the bootstrap distribution, we (1) sample with replacement pairs from one list, (2) compute the correlation between the resampled ranking and unused ranking when using accuracy versus \irt{} score, and (3) compute and store the \irt{} correlation score minus the accuracy correlation score.
We repeat this process 1000 times for each of the 10 trials in the original experiment and aggregate all the differences to build the bootstrap distribution.
For each sample size we compute the empirical P-Value on each trial which we show in box and whisker plots (Figure~\ref{fig:rank_sig}).

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ranking_stability_significance}
  \caption{
    P-values of the rank correlation difference for each sample size and trial in Figure~\ref{fig:stability}.
    The inherent noise in dev set sampling makes inferring significance difficult (left); test set driven results (right) are more significant.
  }
  \label{fig:rank_sig}
\end{figure*}


\section{The IRT Statistical Test}
\label{ch:isicle:irt-test}

The \irt{} test differs in two substantial ways from other tests: (1) it does not assume that \itms{} are equally informative and (2) it does assume that the informativeness of \itms{} is a function of the \subj{}'s skill $\theta_j$.
In the literature, this is closely connected to \iemph{reliability}~\citep{sutcliffe1992pragmatics} and each \itm{} provides information about the location of $\theta_j$; as we accumulate more evidence for the location of $\theta_j$ the error of estimation decreases.
It is a well known result in \irt{} that standard error of estimate (\abr{see}) $\sigma(\hat{\theta}|\theta)$ varies with respect to the agent location parameter $\theta$~\citep[p.~30]{theory2013ayala} and is connected to the Fisher information
\begin{equation}
  I_i(\theta)=\frac{(p_i')^2}{p_i(1-p_i)}
\end{equation}
of each item.
For a 2PL model, information
\begin{equation}
  I_i(\theta)=\gamma^2p_i(1-p_i)
\end{equation}
is maximized when $p_i=(1-p_i)$.
Since Fisher information is additive, the information of the evaluation set is maximal when \itms{} have a $50\%$ chance of being responded to correctly.
As derived by~\citet[p.~102]{theory2013ayala}, the standard error of estimation
\begin{equation}
  \text{SEE}(\theta)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_i I_i(\theta)}}.
\end{equation}
is computed by accumulating the information gained from each \itm{}.
Given two \subjs{} $X$ and $Y$, one can use the probability distribution of score differences
\begin{equation}
  N(\theta_Y-\theta_X, \text{SEE}(\theta_X)^2+\text{SEE}(\theta_Y)^2)
\end{equation}
to compute the probability that the difference in skill is greater than two standard errors which corresponds to an $\alpha\le .05$ significance level.

\section{Multidimensional IRT Clustering}
\label{ch:isicle:clustering}

While we achieve strong held-out accuracy with 10 dimensional \irt{} (\pl{m}), we had limited success in interpreting parameters.
We use \abr{tsne}\footnote{
  We use openTSNE~\citep{policar2019tsne} with default parameters.
} plots overlayed with features like \itm{} accuracy, the question's Wikipedia page, if the question was answerable, length of questions, and topic model weights.
Of these, \itm{} accuracy and answerability showed the most obvious patterns (Figure~\ref{fig:tsne-squad}).

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{squad_tsne}
  \caption{
    In \squad{}, \abr{tsne} shows a relationship between mean exact match (\itm{} accuracy) and answerability with respect to multidimensional \diff{} and \discability{}.
  }
  \label{fig:tsne-squad}
\end{figure}

We repeated this approach with the multi-task question answering shared task \abr{mrqa}~\citep{fisch2019mrqa}.
However, instead of using 10 dimensions we use 6 to match the number of development set tasks in \abr{mrqa}.
Although questions in NarrativeQA standout (Figure~\ref{fig:tsne-mrqa}), there is not a discernible pattern amongst the other tasks.
We leave more sophisticated methods for making multidimensional \irt{} models interpretable to future work.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{mrqa_tsne}
  \caption{
    In \abr{mrqa}, \abr{tsne} shows a relationship between whether the task is NarrativeQA with respect to multidimensional \diff{} and \discability{}.

\end{figure}



\section{Reproducibility Checklist}

Here we provide reproducibility details to complement our source code (\href{https://irt.pedro.ai}{https://irt.pedro.ai}).

\subsection{Software and Parameters}

All \irt{} models are implemented in PyTorch~\citep{pytorch2019} and Pyro~\citep{bingham2018pyro}.
Linear models are trained with Vowpal Wabbit~\citep{Agarwal2014ARE}.
The topic model that generates features for the linear model uses Mallet~\citep{McCallumMALLET}.

The number of \irt{} model parameters is proportional to the number of \subjs{} $m$ and the number of \itms{} $n$.
The \pl{1}~has one parameter per \subj{} and one per \itm{}.
The \pl{2}~has one parameter per \subj{} and two per \itm{}.
The \pl{3}~has one parameter per \subj{} and three per \itm{}.
The \pl{m}~has ten parameters per \subj{} and thirty per \itm{}.

\subsection{Hyperparameters}

We did not invest significant effort in hyper-parameter tuning the \irt{} models and instead used the defaults in the py-irt software\footnote{\href{https://github.com/jplalor/py-irt}{github.com/jplalor/py-irt}} provided by~\citet{lalor2019latent}.
The \pl{1}, \pl{2}, and \pl{3}~models were trained for 1000 epochs with no early stopping conditions and a learning rate of $0.1$ with \abr{adam}~\citep{Kingma2014AdamAM}.
The \pl{m}~model was trained for 2500 epochs and used 10 dimensions.

In the linear model, we used a Hyperopt-based~\citep{bergstra2013hyperopt} tool provided by Vowpal Wabbit\footnote{
  \href{https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit}{github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal\_wabbit}
} for hyper parameter search.
For each \abr{lm}, the tool spent 20 iterations optimizing the learning rate, L2 regularization, and number of bits against the logistic loss function.
The learning rate was searched from 0.001 to 10 with loguniform sampling, L2 regularization from $1e-8$ to 1, and bits from 20 to 23 as categorical variables.

The topic model that generated features for the linear model used mallet, and we followed the recommendations of the software to set hyper parameters.\footnote{
  \href{http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php}{mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php}
}
Specifically, we used an optimization interval of 10, removed stop words, trained for 1000 iterations, and used a document-topic threshold of 0.05.
Each document was comprised of the Wikipedia page title and the question text.

\subsection{Computational Resources}

The majority of experiments were conducted on a single workstation with an Intel i7-7700K \abr{cpu}, $47$\abr{gb} of \abr{ram}, and an Nvidia 1080Ti.
The average runtime for the \pl{3}~model on \abr{cpu} is 113 seconds with a standard deviation of 2.31 over 5 trials.
The average runtime of the \pl{m}~model on \abr{gpu} is 110 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.5 over 5 trials.

Since each ranking stability experiment required (\S\ref{ch:isicle:stable}) re-training an \pl{3}~model on each subset, we parallelized this experiment on a \abr{cpu} cluster where each trial received two \abr{cpu} cores and 16\abr{gb} of \abr{ram}.
In total, this included 520 trials which corresponds to twice that many trained \irt{} models since one model is trained on each subset of the data.
