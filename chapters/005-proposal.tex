{\bf Questioning Artificial Intelligence}: How the Art of Asking Questions Defines AI and Helps Navigate an Uncertain Future

\vspace{3cm}


\paragraph{Brief Blurb}

This book is not a complete introduction about how to build \abr{ai} systems
or how use natural language processing to extract answers from Wikipedia.
%
Nor is it an insider's guide to the world of high-stakes educational testing,
trivia games, or licensing exams.
%
But by introducing the reader to all of these places where questions
are being answered, this book helps introduce the reader to what it
takes for humans or computers to answer questions. 

By drawing those \emph{connections} between the two worlds of human
and computer question answering, this book shows how human
expectations of \abr{qa} have shaped \abr{ai}, how there's still more
to learn from human \abr{qa}, and how a more mature \abr{ai} landscape
may change how humans answer questions for fun and in the jobs of the
21\textsuperscript{st} century.

\paragraph{Text Type and Market}

The book is intended either for the general public to learn about human and computer
question answering or for machine learning researchers to learn
how \emph{human} question answering can improve their computer question
answering systems.

Possible classes where it could be used:
\begin{itemize}
        \item A freshman seminar introducing students to \abr{ai}
          through the lens of question answering.
        \item A graduate seminar in information seeking or evaluation
          in information science.
        \item A companion to technical papers in a graduate computer
          science course.  And this is how I have used chapter drafts:
          as an overview to show the ``big picture'' of the technical
          papers we read.
\end{itemize}

The book is based on a course that I teach at the University of
Maryland.  The lectures are available online, and the most common
international visitors are from:
\begin{itemize}
\item India
\item China
  \item Germany
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Competition}

\begin{itemize}
        \item Ken Jennings.  \textit{Braniac: Adventures in the Curious,
        Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs}.  Villard, 2007.

        \item Mark T. Maybury.  \textit{New Directions in Question
        Answering}.  AAAI Press, 2004.

        \item Navin Sabharwal and Amit Agrawal.  \textit{Hands-on Question
        Answering Systems with BERT}.  A Press, 2021.
\end{itemize}

These books are different because they either focus on \emph{human}
question answering or \emph{computer} question answering, but not
drawing the connection between the two.

\paragraph{Length and Schedule}

Estimated book contents:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 150 Single-spaced pages
  \item Two dozen diagrams / illustrations
  \item Draft to reviewers January 31, 2025, revisions/edits until
    August 31, 2025
\end{itemize}

Three chapters were published as position papers.  If accepted, the
chapters will be substantially revised to flow well with and
complement other chapters.

Sample chapter to follow.
