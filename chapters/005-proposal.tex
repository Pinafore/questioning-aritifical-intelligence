{\bf Questioning Artificial Intelligence}: How the Art of Asking Questions Defines AI and Helps Navigate an Uncertain Future

\vspace{3cm}


\paragraph{Brief Blurb}

When we ask either a student or an \abr{ai} questions, we learn how
smart they are.
%
This book helps connect the arcana of how to build \abr{ai} systems
and extract answers from Wikipedia to an insider's view of high-stakes
trivia games.
%
% But by introducing the reader to all of these places where questions
% a re being answered, this book helps introduce the reader to what it
% takes for humans or computers to answer questions. 

By drawing those \emph{connections} between the two worlds of human
and computer question answering (\abr{qa} for short), this book shows how human
expectations of \abr{qa} have shaped \abr{ai}, how there's still more
to learn from human \abr{qa}, and how a more mature \abr{ai} landscape
may change how humans answer questions for fun and in the jobs of the
21\textsuperscript{st} century.

\paragraph{Text Type and Market}

The book is intended as an ``armchair scientist'' in the general public to learn about human and computer
question answering.
%
or for machine learning researchers to learn
how \emph{human} question answering can improve their computer question
answering systems.

For example, a trivia enthusiast curious about how their hobby relates
to modern \abr{ai} could benefit from the book and see how the style
of asking questions perfected by years of iterative refinement in quiz
bowl tournaments, game shows, and pub quizzes show that maybe \abr{ai}
isn't as good as it says it is.

Likewise, a more casual reader who is familiar with trivia games (but
not necessarily an expert) might see these accessible, human-centered
games as a scaffold to better understand the challenge of knowing
whether a new \abr{ai} is good or not.
%
It will also show the development of \abr{ai} over the last few
decades compared to human abilities.

Moreover, the book can serve as a ``unifying'' textbook in courses.
Although it is not technically deep, it could be used in:
\begin{itemize}
        \item A freshman seminar introducing students to \abr{ai}
          through the lens of question answering.
        \item A graduate seminar in information seeking or evaluation
          in information science.
        \item A companion to technical papers in a graduate computer
          science course.  And this is how I have used chapter drafts:
          as an overview to show the ``big picture'' of the technical
          papers we read.
\end{itemize}

The book is based on a course that I teach at the University of
Maryland.  The lectures are available online, and the most common
international visitors are from:
\begin{itemize}
\item India
\item China
  \item Germany
\end{itemize}

These books are different because they either focus on \emph{human}
question answering or \emph{computer} question answering, but not
drawing the connection between the two.

\paragraph{Length and Schedule}

Estimated book contents:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 150 Single-spaced pages
  \item Two dozen diagrams / illustrations
  \item Draft to reviewers July 31, 2026, revisions/edits until
    December 31, 2026
\end{itemize}

Three chapters were published as position papers.  If accepted, the
chapters will be substantially revised to flow well with and
complement other chapters.
