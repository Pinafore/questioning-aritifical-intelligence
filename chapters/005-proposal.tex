{\bf Questioning Artificial Intelligence}: How the Art of Asking Questions Defines AI and Helps Navigate an Uncertain Future

\vspace{3cm}


\paragraph{Full Description}



This book is not a complete introduction about how to build \abr{ai} systems
or how use natural language processing to extract answers from Wikipedia.
%
Nor is it an insider's guide to the world of high-stakes educational testing,
trivia games, or licensing exams.
%
We'll only introduce the reader to all of these interesting subcultures
from the trivial to the technical.

Unlike highly focused books on those individual domains, the goal of this book is to
draw \emph{connections} between the two worlds of human and computer
question answering, show how human expectations of \abr{qa} have
shaped \abr{ai} thus far, how there's still more to learn from
human \abr{qa}, and how a more mature \abr{ai} landscape may change
how humans answer questions.
