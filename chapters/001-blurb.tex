\abr{ai} has been defined by asking questions even before it was ``a
thing'': Alan Turing designed a question answering proceduring to
determine if machine is intelligent.
%
In the years since, \abr{ai} has continued to be defined by questions:
answering questions on \jeopardy{} and on our phones.

This book looks at not just the \emph{how} of computers answers
questions but also \emph{why} answering questions is so important
for \abr{ai}.
%
Answering that ``why'' questions requires us to go back to
mythological, civil service exams, and game shows and connect them
to \abr{ai} question answering.
